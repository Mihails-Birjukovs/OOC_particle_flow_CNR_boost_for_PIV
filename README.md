# OOC_particle_flow_CNR_boost_for_PIV
A Wolfram Mathematica image processing code for boosting the SNR/CNR of particle flow images in microfluidic channels. Context: organ on a chip (OOC) devices.

Code output: filtered images for image-based velocimetry and (optionally) particle masks/coordinates for tracking.

Some of the underlying methods are explained in
